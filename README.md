Last week a lot of people made an effort to come to our event.  We're very sorry that we had to turn you away.

This was our fault. Although we booked the venue some weeks ago, sent emails, and called the venue a week before the event, there was a miscommunication and the venue wasn't ready for us.

We should have done more to make sure that everything was in place to make the event run smoothly, and provided you more notice when there was a problem.

A lot of people worked hard to make our March meetup happen:
 * Haybrook IT had provided sponsorship & support
 * Pusher had organised professional filming of our event
 * Adam Leskis and Joe Reeve had prepared talks

And of course everyone that made the effort to attend our event.

The people that make up JSOxford are extremely important to us, and it's been awesome to see us grow over the last three and a half years.  We don't take the community for granted and we're committed to making sure this never happens again.

As a priority, we will meet with the venue's management to put a process in place which guarantees the venue's availability. From today we will also contact the venue on the day of the event to get a final confirmation.

As always we'd appreciate your input, and if there's anything more we can do please get in touch.

Moving our events to a new venue was an important milestone for us because it supports the continued growth of the community.  We're hugely excited about the future of JSOxford, and we look forward to sharing some exciting announcements with you.
